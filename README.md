## Introduction

The double factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \) is the product of all the integers from \( n \) down to 1 that have the same parity as \( n \). For example, the double factorial of 6 is \( 6 \times 4 \times 2 = 48 \), and the double factorial of 5 is \( 5 \times 3 \times 1 = 15 \).

This repository focuses on the maximum value of the nth double factorial that can be represented in a double-precision floating-point format, adhering to the IEEE 754 standard. This value is crucial for applications in scientific computing, numerical analysis, and statistical modeling.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/feiyingjun/constants-float64-max-nth-double-factorial/releases). Make sure to execute the downloaded file according to the instructions provided.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript.

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary files, you can utilize the constant in your JavaScript code. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
const maxNthDoubleFactorial = require('constants-float64-max-nth-double-factorial');

console.log(`The maximum nth double factorial is: ${maxNthDoubleFactorial}`);
```

This will log the maximum value of the nth double factorial to the console.

### Example Calculation

To demonstrate how to calculate a double factorial, consider the following function:

```javascript
function doubleFactorial(n) {
    if (n < 0) return undefined; // Not defined for negative numbers
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) return 1; // Base case
    return n * doubleFactorial(n - 2); // Recursive call
}

console.log(doubleFactorial(6)); // Outputs: 48
console.log(doubleFactorial(5)); // Outputs: 15
```

This function recursively calculates the double factorial for a given integer \( n \).
